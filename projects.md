# üîç Cybersecurity Projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## TryHackMe ‚Äì Pre-Security & SOC Level 1
- Completed structured learning paths covering core cybersecurity concepts
- Earned certificates of completion

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Python SSH_Analyzer
- A Python-based script that parses SSH logs to detect brute-force attacks, suspicious logins, and unauthorized access attempts.
  The script is integrated with a SIEM (Splunk), for easiar monitoring and detection.

## üõ°Ô∏è Home SOC Lab Project ‚Äì Threat Detection & Analysis Simulation
#### 1. Introduction
- This project simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment in a home lab setting. It was created to develop and demonstrate key skills required for a 
  SOC Analyst Level 1 position. The lab involves setting up virtual machines, configuring a SIEM tool, simulating attacks, detecting threats, and documenting the 
  analysis.
#### 2. Objectives
- Build a virtual SOC environment using VMware with Kali Linux and Ubuntu
- Install and configure a SIEM tool
- Simulate cyber attacks
- Detect and analyze suspicious activities
- Document incidents and map them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
#### 3. Tools & Technologies Used
- VMware Workstation
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Server
- SIEM Tool (e.g., Wazuh or Splunk)
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Wireshark, Sysmon, Log sources (Syslog, etc.)
#### 4. Lab Setup
The lab was built using VMware Workstation with the following components:
- Kali Linux: Used as the attacker machine to simulate cyber threats
- Ubuntu Server: Configured with logging and monitored by the SIEM
- SIEM Tool: Installed to collect, analyze, and alert on security logs
